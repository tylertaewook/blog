My name is Tyler, a first-year undergrad at Columbia SEAS pursuing towards a B.S. in Computer Science. My general interest revolves around intertwining Machine Learning and Web Development in which I spark my passion working on ML Web apps such as scraft.ai. I'm curently exploring fields like text-mining, arduino-robotics, computer-vision, and reinforcement-learning until I settle onto a single one that I would like to dive deeper.
